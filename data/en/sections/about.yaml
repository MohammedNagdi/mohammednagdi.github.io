summary: |

    I’m an AI and Machine Learning enthusiast with an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh and awarded the Google DeepMind Scholarship. I specialise in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have a strong background in time-series forecasting, recommender systems, and system identification.

    Driven by a passion for AI since my undergraduate studies, I co-organized Indabax conferences in Sudan and pursued my master’s to apply technical advancements in AI. With experience as a Software Engineer at Zain, I engineered data integration solutions and developed APIs processing over 1M+ daily transactions. My research includes time-series foundational models, reinforcement learning, and system identification using Koopman theory and GPT architecture.

    I aim to contribute to impactful AI projects, leveraging my expertise in ML, NLP, and software engineering to drive innovation and ethical AI practices.
